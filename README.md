Taskly is a comprehensive mobile task management application built with React Native. It empowers users to efficiently organize their daily activities through a rich feature set, including biometric authentication, task prioritization, and profile customization. The application's UI/UX was meticulously crafted based on the design specifications from [this Figma project](https://www.figma.com/design/4CRUTjHYX89xCfdUhFl8ft/Taskly-UI?node-id=0-1&p=f&t=UpMIbWXKVb1WbQdA-0).

This project is now fully functional, with its backend API hosted on **AWS EC2** and user avatars stored and served via **AWS S3**.
